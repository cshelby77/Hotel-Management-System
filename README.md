Task: Hotel Reservation System (HRS)

Design: This application is seperated into 4 broad parts: Users (Guest/Host), Messages, Reservations, and Hotel Rooms.

Servlets: All buisness logic is contained within the servlets (controllers). Each one contains multiple tasks depending
	on the HttpMethod and User type stored within the session created during login().

DOAs: There all five daos that are used to access a table with simular names.

Models: There all five models that are used to store infromation from a table with the same name.

Most functions contain comments that detail what calls is and a short description on what they do.

Still Needs Work: Almost all the front end. 

TO START: 1.) login/create profile
	  2.) Manually redirect to index.html
